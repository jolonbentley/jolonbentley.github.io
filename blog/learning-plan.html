          <em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em>
        </h4>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to work for myself as a full stack developer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          <em
            >A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          My strengths are being resilient, so perservering even when learning
          becomes difficult and enjoying challenging myself. My weaknesses are
          needing a deep understanding at times in order to understand certain
          concepts and getting bored or distracted.
        </p>

          <em
            >What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          I'm pretty happy with who I am and the experience I have gained from
          working as an airline pilot. I can't think of any other skills I would
          like to from Dev Academy when it comes to that side of things.
        </p>

            >A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
            programme. This should include: An explanation of how you will
            manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
            Facilitators and industry/community representatives, and what you
            will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          I will manage my workload by chipping away everyday, asking questions
          when neccesary, and not getting carried away (time wise) on one task.
          If things become a bit much, I will communicate with the relevant
          person in a professional manner and if I need to vent, my partner is a
          great listener and support person for me.

        <p>
          ChatGPT is great for getting answers to technical questions in a
          timely manner. If it is something else or beyond the scope of ChatGPT,
          I will seek help through Discord.

          My partner is pregnant at the moment, so the only thing that may need
          my attention outside of the course would be supporting her outside of
          the normal scope of pregnancy stuff. Everything inside the normal
          scope is planned and organised.
