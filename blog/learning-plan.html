        </h4>
        <p>
          The same as they were through foundations. To be able to work for
          myself as a full stack developer.

            Bootcamp?</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          My biggest strengths will probably be making sure I finish the
          program, and having the drive to do it even when it gets tough. My
          biggest limitation will be balancing my family life with the workload.

            will be?</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          Probably as said in the previous question, balancing my family life
          with the workload. As much as I have great support in my partner, I
          know my kids will continuously try to distract me.
        </p>

        </h4>
        <p>
          I need to develop more discipline. Since I've stopped flying as a
          pilot, my standards in discipline have definitely fallen off, so I
          would like to recapture some of that.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <em>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</em>
        </h4>
        <p>
          I guess to facilitate the program well. I would hope the
          lessons/lectures are presented in an easy to understand way. Lastly, I
          think just be there to clarify any ambiguities that may present
          themselves. I'm highly confident the team will do an amazing job
          though, given it's been great so far!

          To learn the necessary technical things that are taught to us. I want
          to walk away knowing what has been taught, and I put that pressure on
          myself because that is why I am here. I don't want to finish for the
          sake of finishing, I want to be a better developer.

        <p>
          My long term goal is to work for myself as a full stack developer.

        </h4>
        <p>
          My strengths are being resilient, so perservering even when learning
          becomes difficult and enjoying challenging myself. My weaknesses are
          needing a deep understanding at times in order to understand certain
          concepts and getting bored or distracted.

          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          I'm pretty happy with who I am and the experience I have gained from
          working as an airline pilot. I can't think of any other skills I would
          like to from Dev Academy when it comes to that side of things.

            manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,

        <p>
          I will manage my workload by chipping away everyday, asking questions
          when neccesary, and not getting carried away (time wise) on one task.
          If things become a bit much, I will communicate with the relevant
          person in a professional manner and if I need to vent, my partner is a
          great listener and support person for me.

        <p>
          ChatGPT is great for getting answers to technical questions in a
          timely manner. If it is something else or beyond the scope of ChatGPT,
          I will seek help through Discord.

          My partner is pregnant at the moment, so the only thing that may need
          my attention outside of the course would be supporting her outside of
          the normal scope of pregnancy stuff. Everything inside the normal
          scope is planned and organised.
