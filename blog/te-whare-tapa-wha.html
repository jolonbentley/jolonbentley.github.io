      <p class="blog-text">
        In order to help improve and maintain my physical wellbeing, I have been
        and will continue to run 3km first thing in the morning, four times a
        week. I've also started trying to eat less carbs and more protein with
        the foods I consume.

      <br />
      <h4 class="text-heading">Taha Whanau (Family Wellbeing)</h4>
      <p class="blog-text">
        Improving my family wellbeing by starting every morning, and ending each
        day positively with the relationships within my family. This will be
        achieved by simple "good mornings" and "good nights", as well as maybe
        showing affection in some way.

      <h4 class="text-heading">
        Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)
      </h4>
      <p class="blog-text">
        Reflecting each day as I settle (after putting the kids to bed).
        Spending that quiet time to check in with myself, see what I did well,
        see where I need to improve, then moving on and knowing that each day
        comes with new opportunities to live a fulfilled life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4 class="text-heading">Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h4>
      <p class="blog-text">
        I mentioned reflecting in the previous point to help my emotional and
        mental wellbeing, but it's also going to contribute to strengthening my
        spiritual wellbeing also. Given I have a relationship with God, praying
        and speaking to him helps me bring perspective to my life, as well as
        make feel more spiritually connected to him, life, and the people around
        me.

        Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)
      </h4>
      <p class="blog-text">
        I've been planting plants over the last year or two. These include
        avocado trees, a feijoa tree, a lemon tree, a mandarin tree, a lime
        tree, and a passionfruit vine. Caring for them, watching them grow, and
        seeing some of them bear fruits already makes me feel good and connected
        to them and their development.
