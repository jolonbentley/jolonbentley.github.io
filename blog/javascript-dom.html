          JavaScript, HTML, and CSS collaborate seamlessly in web development.
          HTML shapes the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds
          interactivity. Together, they create dynamic and engaging web
          experiences, with HTML as the structure, CSS as the style, and
          JavaScript as the interactive engine.

          Control flow in coding is like the roadmap for how a program rolls
          through its instructions. It's all about the order things happen, not
          just line by line, but the way your program goes through decisions,
          loops, etc.
        </p>

          The DOM (Document Object Model) is like a backstage pass for web
          developers. It's a way JavaScript interacts with and changes a webpage
          in real-time. For example, you can use it to update a button's text or
          style based on what a user does. It's like having a backstage access
          to modify the webpage on the fly.

          Accessing data from arrays is like grabbing items by number, while
          with objects, it's like using labels to find what you need. Arrays
          rely on order, while objects use keys for organization. Arrays are for
          lists, objects for labeled data.

          Functions in coding are like mini-programs that do specific tasks. You
          tell them what to do by giving them information, they perform the
          task, and then they give you a result. They help keep your code neat,
          avoid repeating the same steps, and make complicated things easier to
          handle. Functions are like handy tools that you can use over and over
          to get things done quickly.
