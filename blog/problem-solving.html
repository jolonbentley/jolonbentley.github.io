        Recently I have been learning JavaScript and have been doing some
        exercises. During this process I have come across a few challenges that
        have had me stumped. One example of these problems was when I had to add
        students to an object, as a property with an empty object from an array.
        It seemed like an easy thing to do, but I just couldn't think of how to
        do it. I used pseudocode to help me really break down what I was trying
        to achieve, but was still stumped on how to do something like that. What
        I realised and had missed was that a simple for of method could achieve
        exactly what I needed. I felt frustrated while first working through
        this problem, as I knew it wasn't an overly complicated problem, but
        what I learnt was that I need become a lot more familiar with
        methods/constructs and how or when they can be applied.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        When it comes to using pseudocode, I feel like I can work on this more
        and find a better, refined way to really break down, using plain
        language, problems I come across. In saying that though, I'm using it
        and know I will get better with practice.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        Trying something is something I feel comfortable with. The only down
        side is sometimes getting stuck in to that trying something method for
        too long.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        I haven't used the rubber ducky method much, but will need to give it a
        try at some point, hen the time arises. I know the concept though and am
        happy with my understanding of it.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        Reading error message is something I'm still getting used to.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        console.logging is a great tool that I feel you need to use when
        testing.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        Googling is also something that I'm sure every single coding does when
        it comes to problem solving. It's great!
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        I haven't really asked my peers for help yet, as anything needed has
        been technical, of which I've managed to find the answer to myself.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        Asking coaches for help is the same as above with asking my peers.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        I feel like I am improving with my reflection, as it is helping me see
        my shortcomings and making me motivated to improve in those areas.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        I haven't really faced a time when I've asked or been reluctant to ask
        for help over the past few weeks. It's obviously something I've faced in
        the past though, and it's usually because I feel embarrased for not
        knowing something that I probably should already know. Getting past that
        feeling is the key to removing that hesitation.
