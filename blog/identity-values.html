          <em>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.</em>
        </h4>
        <p>
          A time I made an ethical decision was when I gave up my seat to an
          elderly lady on the train.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          <em

            the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          I beleive in respecting the needs of others and it is a part of my
          ethical conduct to behave in such a manner. I still think behaving
          that way is good and stand by te decision.

        <p>
          I come from a pacific island background through my Dad and Step Dad.
          Part of the Pacific Island way is to respect your elders. I think that
          has influenced my values, particularly in the example above.

          One of my strengths is perserverance. It'll help me perservere through
          the course, even when I get stuck.

          I sometimes find myself needing a deep understanding in many different
          examples and ways to really nail a concept in my head. This can lead
          to spending too much time on a subject, or even not end up getting the
          concept at all. The time boxing method will help here, as well as
          asking questions in Discord.

        <p>
          One time while co-piloting a plane with someone I was at flying school
          with. We were on an approach in cloud and he was getting low. It
          seemed as though he had tunnel vision on something at that particulr
          time and needed to be refocused on other aspects to the phase of
          flight. The resistance came when I gave my standard call outs of him
          being low, but there was no adjustment.

            why.</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          I tried the standard call outs to make him aware that he was getting
          low, but no adjustments were made. I had to snap him out of it with
          plain clear language that he was getting low on approach and he needed
          to raise the nose and put power in. There are other strategies that I
          didn't use, but could have if things progressed in to a dangerous
          state, such as taking over control of the plane, or initiating a
          go-around. Luckily it never progressed that far.
