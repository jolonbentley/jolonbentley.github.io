          <em
            >What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the core learning?</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          Firstly I have learnt that no matter how hard I try to not have an
          ego, it'll always be there. I've learnt that with age or maybe just
          life experience, I'm becoming more stubborn and set in my ways. Lastly
          I've learnt that I enjoy reflecting, but not routinely.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          <em
            >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
            learning and programming?</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          I guess your values help you make ethical decisions when it comes to
          what you do, how you approach others and your environment. Empathy
          will help when it comes to working with and for others. Self awareness
          will help with guiding your emotions, keeping an open mind, and
          continual self improvememnt within the industry.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          <em>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</em>
        </h4>
        <p>
          How closed minded I can be when it comes to this stuff. As much as I
          don't like doing it, I do it because I don't know best. I guess that's
          the good thing about being self aware, knowing that even though my
          mind automatically wants to reject it, that doesn't mean I should.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          <em>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</em>
        </h4>
        <p>The amount of it there is.</p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          <em
            >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
            time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
            course?</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          Various reasons, but most probably to help prepare a good mind for the
          workplace, collaboration, and problem solving.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          <em
            >Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
            programming instead? Justify your answer.</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          I don't feel like it was a waste of time. I also think depending on
          where you're at in your life it could be more valuable than I may
          realise. I do however feel as though it was too much for me and I
          personally would have preferred spending time doing more programming
          stuff.
